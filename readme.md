# About

This system is built using PHP framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) for back-end and [Angular](https://angular.io/) 7 for front-end.
This was a task for my studies. If someone finds this useful, you can freely take this and modify and use it how you wish. It might be a great insight on how to have laravel and angular in the same app. As there were not a lot of tutorials about this and I pretty much had to configure angular on my 
own to work like this. But you should really think about if you even want this. As It might be a better idea to have laravel and angular as separate apps. Really depends on the use case.
